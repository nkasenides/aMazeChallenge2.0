              aMazeChallenge is a turn-based game in which the player codes their avatar in order to escape from mazes
              full of different hazards and rewards. Players need to write their own code, which determines how their avatar will act in the game using simple
              commands. But be careful! The mazes are unpredictable and will spawn traps or bombs that you need to avoid
              to make it to the end. Various rewards will give you more points or improve your health status.
              The first player to escape the maze wins, but points will give you an advantage too.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify">
              aMazeChallenge is all about programming. You will code in a visual programming language
              called <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockly">Blockly</a> and you will learn the basic
              concepts of programming while you play. But before trying to tackle more difficult mazes and play with others,
              you need to think about how to write your code!
