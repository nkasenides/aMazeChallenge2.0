    <p><b>Play an interactive multiplayer game and learn programming in the process!</b></p>

    <ul class="browser-default">
        <li>aMazeChallenge is game about escaping from mazes full of different hazards and rewards.</li>
        <li>Players need to write their own code, which determines how their avatar will act in the game using
            simple commands (for example move, turn, check for objects nearby etc).</li>
        <li>But be careful! The mazes are unpredictable and will spawn traps or bombs that you need to avoid to make it to the end.</li>
        <li>Rewards will give you more points. The first player to escape the maze wins, but points will give you an advantage too.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>aMazeChallenge is all about programming. You will code in <a style="color: cyan;" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockly">Blockly</a>
        and you will learn the basic concepts of programming while you play. But before trying to tackle more difficult mazes and play with others,
    you need to be trained!</p>
