    <h3>Writing your code (1/3)</h3>

    <h4 style="text-align: center;">The functions</h4>

    <p>There are two functions you need to use in your code:</p>

    <h5>Initialize function</h5>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img class="styledImage"  src="../../images/initialize.jpg"/></div>
    <p>The initialize function runs its instructions only once, before anything else is executed. It is used to declare variables
    that will be used in the rest of the code.</p>

    <h5>Run function</h5>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img class="styledImage"  src="../../images/run.jpg"/></div>
    <p>The run function runs its instructions continuously (at every turn). It is used to contain the algorithm that will
    move the player inside the maze and allow them to reach the end.</p>

    <p>The run function should be "linked" to the initialize function. An empty code structure should look like this:</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img class="styledImage"  src="../../images/structure.jpg"/></div>

    <h5>Useful hints</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Do not place code outside the initialize and run functions. It will not be executed.</li>
        <li>Try to include both initialize and run functions in your code. The run function is mandatory but initialize can be omitted, although better code will need to use both.</li>
        <li>Do not declare any variables inside the run function. This will reset their values each time the algorithm is executed. Declare them in initialize instead.</li>
        <li>Each block's structure indicates what its output or input is. If something does not fit, it was not meant to fit.</li>
        <li>Saving your code after you have made some changes will avoid any accidental losses.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 style="text-align: center;">Moving &amp; Turning</h5>
    <p>Your avatar can perform one of the following actions at each turn. When one of these commands is executed, your turn is completed.</p>

    <h6>Move Forward</h6>
    <p>This will advance your avatar one step forward in the direction it is facing.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../images/move_forward.jpg"/></div>

    <h6>Turn Clockwise</h6>
    <p>Your avatar will turn clockwise (to its right hand side), according to the direction it is facing.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../images/turn_clockwise.jpg"/></div>

    <h6>Turn Counter-Clockwise</h6>
    <p>Your avatar will turn counter-clockwise (to its left hand side), according to the direction it is facing.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../images/turn_counterclockwise.jpg"/></div>

    <h5 style="text-align: center;">Checking for possible moves</h5>
    <p>The following set of functions allows you to check if your avatar can move in a certain direction, so that you avoid missing any turns.
        They will return <b>true</b> if your avatar can move in a certain position or <b>false</b> if it cannot.</p>
