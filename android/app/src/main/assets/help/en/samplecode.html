<h1>Sample code</h1>

<p>There are four sample codes which you can use to learn how to write code and see how the game works.
    In this example we will look at the Left Wall Follower algorithm.
</p>

<p>The left wall follower is a basic maze-solving algorithm which is based on keeping one 'hand' on the left wall at all times.
    In simplest terms the avatar will turn counter-clockwise (left) if it can, otherwise it will keep moving forward.
    Eventually, it will reach the end given that all of the walls in the maze are connected.
</p>

<p>In the sample code for Left Wall Follower, the justTurned variable is initialized to false. It is used so that the avatar will
remember if it has made a turn in the last round or not. The algorithm runs as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The avatar will move forward if it turned during the last round AND it can indeed move forward according to its position and direction.</li>
    <li>If it cannot move forward or it did not turn during the last round, it will attempt to turn counterclockwise (if it can).</li>
    <li>Otherwise it will attempt to move forward (if it can).</li>
    <li>If it cannot turn counterclockwise or move forward, it will turn clockwise.</li>
</ul>

<p>The avatar needs to remember if it turned during the last round (or not) so that it does not turn again if it does not need to, otherwise it could go off course.</p>

<p>You can edit sample code as you like to produce better algorithms and save them on your device.</p>
