        <h1>Training</h1>
        <h3>Selecting a challenge</h3>

        <p>To start a game select a challenge from the challenges list. You will learn how to create your own challenges (mazes) later. All of the available challenges will be displayed in this list. Select the first challenge (Walk the line).</p>
        <div style="text-align: center;"><img class="styledImage"  src="../images/tutorial1_en.jpg"/></div>

        <p>You might be prompted to write code if you have not done so already. In either case, go to the Code Editor and insert the following code:</p>
        <div style="text-align: center;"><img class="styledImage"  src="../images/walkthelinecode.jpg"/></div>

        <p>The selected challenge (Walk the line) is about walking in a straight line. To do that, the only move required is to simply move forward until the end is reached.
            Make sure you compile your code, return to the training screen and select 'Walk the line' again. You should see the following screen:</p>

        <div style="text-align: center;"><img class="styledImage"  src="../images/firstchallenge_en.jpg"/></div>

        <p>This screen shows your position in the maze with an arrow colored with your selected color (and a label "You"). The starting position is colored light red, and the finish position is colored light green.
            Normally, mazes will have walls, but this maze is empty.
        </p>

        <p>Below the maze screen, you can find your current health and points. These will change during the game. Press the 'next' button once. You should notice that your avatar has moved forward
        by one position, just like you instructed it. You may also have noticed different objects appearing inside the maze. These are the pickable objects that we described earlier. Press next again.</p>

        <p>Your avatar should now be at the middle of the maze. The next button performs one move at each time. To perform moves continuously, you can press the play/pause button (but do not press it yet). The interval will determine
        how fast moves will be executed (less is faster). You can press 'View Details' to your statistics in the current game.</p>

        <p>Press the play button to finish the maze.</p>
