        <h3>Creating a challenge</h3>

        <p>You can use the Maze Designer to create your own maze challenges.</p>

        <div style="text-align: center;"><img class="styledImage"  src="../images/mazedesigner1_en.jpg"/></div>

        <p>Provide a name (only letters and numbers, no spaces) and a description for your challenge. The selected algorithm will determine if your challenge
        will have one or multiple solutions or if it will have a low number of walls or no walls at all.</p>

        <div style="text-align: center;"><img class="styledImage"  src="../images/mazedesigner2_en.jpg"/></div>

        <p>Select the size of your maze and the starting and ending positions. The numbers start from the top left and end on the bottom right. For example, a starting position with
            row = 0 and column = 0 will be on the top left and a target position with row = 4 and column = 4 will be on the bottom right.</p>

        <div style="text-align: center;"><img class="styledImage"  src="../images/mazedesigner3_en.jpg"/></div>

        <p>You can also select the number of reward and penalty pickables in your maze. Setting the values to Low will have less of the selected kind and setting them to High will produce more.
        Alternatively you can avoid having penalties or obstacles by selecting 'none'.</p>

        <p>Below these options you can select the wall color of the maze and the background image to use from a pre-defined list. Make sure you use colors that contrast each other
        otherwise the maze walls will not be visible.</p>

        <div style="text-align: center;"><img class="styledImage"  src="../images/mazedesigner4_en.jpg"/></div>

        <p>Finally, you can also choose a background audio for your maze based on its theme from a pre-defined list.</p>

        <p>When you are done, click the 'Generate' button and review your generated maze. Then you can add the generated maze to training.</p>

        <h3>Editing/Deleting a challenge</h3>

        <p>To edit or delete a challenge, long click on it from your list of challenges in Training. The following dialog will appear:</p>

        <div style="text-align: center;"><img class="styledImage"  src="../images/deletemaze_en.jpg"/></div>
