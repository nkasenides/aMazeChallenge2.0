### Privacy policy
The app requests access to the user account to simplify the collection of name/email in the Personalization screen. You can still set an alias name and email before connecting to the online server. Also, connecting to the online server (and thus registering to play with these credentials) is optional.
In some cases, the app will ask you to fill in a questionnaire. These data are collected purely for research purposes.
